President Bush in my opinion is  a genuinely kind and a true leader no President 100% nor Obama not Clinton etc However the relationship this 3 former Presidents should be a role model to us all. Let the hate and anger aside which is probably what is taking our country to a inevitable Communism because the@way things are right at this moment is the prelude of a catastrophic socialism and we must be smart enough and put our passionate and antagonist attitude. It seems impossible back then to have a black president in USA and we did so we are not exempt from becoming a communist country, because the anarchism we have let happened it’s gearing us to it. Be smart enough or educate a little bit more when accusing someone of causing one of the worse terrorist attacks to our Beloved USA 🇺🇸 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 🙏🏻Peace.
